# Streamer-Clipboard-Manager
A small clipboard manager I made for a streamer friend. He said this was just perfect
but in hindsight I can see a lot of room for improvement in this (responsiveness!).

The purpose of this is that streamers sometimes have identical messages they
want to paste in chat over and over, for example when taking a break. This
solves the need to type it over and over again, and instead it becomes just about
two mouse clicks.

Instructions:
Run "Clipboard Manager.exe".
To the right of "Folder Path", click on the gray button icon. This will allow you
to choose a folder with .txt files (like the project folder, which has 
"Example Messages 1.txt" and "Example Messages 2.txt").
Choose the txt file that has a message you want to instantly copy on the
left-side panel, and then click on the message that shows up on the
right-side panel. The message will be copied to your clipboard as though
you've copied a text message, and whenever you ctrl+v paste it, it should
paste the proper selected message. Multi-select is not functioning properly,
and instead of allowing you to select multiple messages, it selects ALL of them.
